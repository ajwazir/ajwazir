### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I am Asim Jahangir Khan.
Currently, I am trying to learn Data-Science (SQL, Python etc) in order to add a bit to my previous knowledge base. Hope to improve on this front pretty quickly. 
Apart from that, I am an Environmental engineer by profession and may have some expertise in the following fields:
* Experienced Researcher with a demonstrated history of working in the environmental science and engineering sectors. 
* Skilled in Surface Water Hydrology, Climate change impact analysis, Water Quality, Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Laboratory operationalization.
* have extensive experience in both basic and applied research and related funding proposals and documentation, worked in local and international funded projects,  and over 3 years experience as an assistant professor, delivering lectures and supervising research; mainly in subject areas such as:
  * hydrological and hydraulic modelling;
  * Climate change projection and its application to water resource dynamics; 
  * water quantity and quality monitoring/estimation;
  * EIA and EMS; and
  * Wastewater Treatment.
* Currently, alongside my data science course, I am providing my services as a (freelance) Environmental consultant. 
In general, I am quite familiar with the various engineering, scientific and analytical procedures/techniques to address water resource issues, relevant data acquisition & management and their further analysis and modelling.

You are welcome to ask me if you need help in the above mention fields.
